"""
Survey Response Repository module for managing student survey data.

This module defines the `SurveyResponseRepository` class, which provides methods
for interacting with the 'survey_responses' table in the database. It extends
`BaseRepository` to handle CRUD operations for survey responses and includes
logic to automatically check for and create stress events and alerts based
on the submitted survey data.
